        DESIGN BRIEF:
        Today's news is heavy with state power—tariffs, immigration raids, military threats,
        court rulings on constitutional limits. I'm designing around the concept of borders
        and boundaries: thick dividing lines, contained blocks, a palette of authority (deep navy,
        warning amber, stark white). The expand/collapse mechanism becomes a metaphor for
        controlled access to information.

This move could significantly impact major trading partners including India, China, and the United Arab Emirates. The tariff announcement represents an escalation in U.S. sanctions policy against Iran. The decision comes amid ongoing tensions in the region and could have widespread economic implications for international trade.

                            <p class="summary">The UK communications regulator Ofcom has launched a formal investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform X regarding its AI chatbot Grok. The investigation follows reports that Grok has been used to generate nonconsensual sexual deepfakes. Malaysia and Indonesia have become the first countries to block Grok entirely after authorities said it was being misused to generate sexually explicit and non-consensual images. The controversy highlights growing concerns about AI-generated content and platform accountability. This represents a significant challenge for Elon Musk's xAI as regulators worldwide examine the technology's potential for abuse.</p>

The achievement represents another chapter in Kohli's illustrious career. India defeated New Zealand in the 1st ODI thanks to a rescue stand between KL Rahul and Harshit Rana along with Kohli's batting.</p>

The supplemental NDA is supported by data from the phase 3 DUPLEX study and phase 2 DUET study. Findings showed sparsentan significantly reduced proteinuria compared with irbesartan in children and adults with FSGS. If approved, sparsentan would be the first treatment for this rare kidney disease. The decision marks a critical milestone for patients with FSGS who currently have no approved therapies.</p>

                            <p class="summary">On January 2, 2026, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Baird v. Bonta that California's restrictions on the open carry of firearms violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments. The three-judge panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's summary judgment, finding that California law strictly prohibits the issuance of open-carry permits in areas where 95% of Californians live. The court held that the overwhelming historical consensus from both 1791 and 1868 makes clear that open carry was protected, distinguishing it from concealed carry bans that were permitted. The decision represents a significant Second Amendment ruling with implications for state firearms regulations, particularly in populous areas.</p>

                            <p class="summary">The Supreme Court denied President Trump's application to stay an injunction blocking the federalization of the Illinois National Guard in a 6-3 vote on December 23, 2025. The majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett, and Jackson, interpreted 10 U.S.C. §12406(3) to mean that 'regular forces' refers to active-duty armed forces, not the National Guard. Justice Kavanaugh filed a concurring opinion, while Justices Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch dissented. The decision has significant implications for presidential power to deploy military forces domestically and establishes important limits on the executive's ability to federalize state National Guard units over governors' objections. The ruling may also impact future interpretations of the Insurrection Act.</p>

                <h2>Designer's Notes</h2>
                <p>Today feels like a day about jurisdictions and enforcement—who has authority, where boundaries are drawn, what gets contained and what spills over. I designed around that tension: thick borders everywhere, information locked behind expandable panels that you must actively choose to open. The amber-and-navy palette borrows from warning systems and official documents. I keep wondering about that FDA decision happening literally today—this quiet bureaucratic milestone tucked between stories of mass deployments and court battles over presidential power.</p>
