    DESIGN BRIEF:
    Today felt like a day for restraint and clarity—pure typographic hierarchy with no decoration. 
    The news is heavy (protests, deaths, constitutional crises) but not apocalyptic, so I wanted 
    a design that feels like a well-edited newspaper: confident scale shifts, generous whitespace, 
    and rhythm built entirely through type weight and spacing. Let the words breathe.

                    About 2,000 people have been killed in ongoing protests in Iran according to an Iranian official who told Reuters the deaths included both protesters and security personnel. The official attributed the deaths to terrorists but provided no breakdown of casualties. U.S.-based Human Rights Activist News Agency reported that 10,721 people had been arrested and identified hundreds of those killed in the anti-government protests. Iran has eased some restrictions, allowing mobile phone calls abroad, but has not restored internet access or texting services. The protests have been driven by economic crisis linked to U.S. sanctions.

                    The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul have sued the federal government to halt what they describe as an unprecedented surge of federal immigration agents into the state. ICE agents in Minneapolis reportedly fired tear gas and pepper spray at protests over immigration raids. Four top DOJ officials resigned over a decision not to probe an ICE killing of Renee Good. The lawsuit comes amid heightened tensions over federal immigration enforcement policies. The family of Keith Porter, a Black father killed by an off-duty ICE agent, is demanding justice.

                    An intense winter storm in Gaza has killed at least eight Palestinians as strong winds toppled numerous buildings and temporary shelters across the Gaza Strip. In Gaza City, three people died when a weakened wall collapsed on their tent, including a 15-year-old girl. Qatar has repeated calls for Israel to allow more aid into the besieged strip. Additionally, a headstone was finally placed on the grave of Palestinian poet Refaat Alareer, more than two years after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike on December 6, 2023.

The yen weakened to ¥158-to-the-dollar territory and 10-year Japanese government bonds fell. Bitcoin hovered around $91,000 showing little direction as traders focused on global equity moves.

                            The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Monday in Chevron USA v. Plaquemines Parish, a case that could determine whether oil companies can move state environmental lawsuits to friendlier federal courts. At stake is a Louisiana state jury verdict ordering Chevron to pay $745 million for wetlands restoration. The case centers on a World War II-era statute and whether oil production for federal wartime contracts decades ago allows removal to federal jurisdiction. Chief Justice Roberts and other justices questioned how far this precedent could extend, with potential implications for countless state court cases against corporations with any historical federal contracts.

                            A GAO audit published January 5 found that four out of five federal programs examined failed to document key fraud prevention processes, contrary to legal requirements and leading practices. The programs award billions annually but lack systematic fraud risk assessments. The report highlights a gap between anti-fraud mandates and actual implementation across agencies. This comes as federal oversight mechanisms face significant disruption, with multiple inspector general offices losing substantial staff in 2025.

                            A January 12 GAO report found that in half of interviews with law enforcement agencies, officers said they may not know how to properly respond to alerts when state database systems flag a name matching the FBI's terrorist watchlist during routine traffic stops. The alerts appear in state systems but often lack clear guidance on appropriate action. The finding raises questions about both civil liberties and officer safety during routine encounters where watchlist matches may be false positives or lack actionable context.

                            In a December 23 ruling, the Supreme Court voted 6-3 to block President Trump's attempt to federalize Illinois National Guard forces, finding he likely lacked authority under the statute invoked. Legal analysts note the decision's reasoning creates new obstacles for two alternative paths: deploying active-duty forces under inherent constitutional authority or invoking the Insurrection Act. The majority held that federalization is only permitted when active-duty forces would be insufficient—a standard the administration did not meet. Trump withdrew similar deployments in Los Angeles and Portland following the ruling but promised to return "in a much different and stronger form."

                Today felt like a day for restraint. The news is serious—2,000 dead in Iran, constitutional battles, people dying in winter storms—but it doesn't feel apocalyptic, just heavy in the way the news often is. So instead of dramatic gestures, I wanted pure typographic hierarchy: big headlines where they belong, smaller ones where they don't, and lots of air between things. Sometimes the best design decision is knowing when to get out of the way.
