    DESIGN BRIEF:
    Van Der Beek's death demanded something respectful, commemorative—an obituary page, but dignified. 
    Today becomes a memorial broadsheet: black ribbon across the top, his story in a mourning-bordered frame, 
    other news organized with typographic restraint. It's quiet, classical, serious without being melodramatic. 
    The page pays respect without pretending the world stopped.

                    President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on February 11, 2026, in a meeting that lasted approximately three hours. Trump stated he 'insisted' that negotiations with Iran continue to see if a deal can be reached, saying a diplomatic solution would be his preference. Trump referenced the June 2025 'Midnight Hammer' strikes on Iran's nuclear sites as leverage. The Pentagon has reportedly instructed another aircraft carrier strike group to prepare for possible deployment to the Middle East amid preparations for potential military action against Iran.

                    U.S. employers added 130,000 jobs in January as the unemployment rate dipped to 4.3% from 4.4% in December, according to the latest jobs report released February 11, 2026. The job market showed some improvement compared to recent months. However, annual revisions revealed that job growth in 2025 was far weaker than initially reported. The data suggests the labor market is thawing somewhat after a period of cooling, though growth remains modest by historical standards.

Meanwhile, 41-year-old skiing legend Lindsey Vonn, who came out of retirement to compete, crashed seconds into her downhill race on Sunday.

                    <p class="brief-summary">
                        Federal prosecutors failed to secure an indictment against Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and five other Democratic lawmakers over a video urging service members and intelligence officials to disobey any illegal orders. Kelly continued to criticize President Trump after the failed indictment, telling CNN that Trump 'wants me to go to prison' because he doesn't like how Kelly is doing his job. Kelly called the attempted prosecution 'right out of the authoritarian playbook,' comparing it to tactics used in China and Russia.

                <div class="brief-content">
                    <p class="brief-summary">
                        The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that cumulative deficits from 2026 to 2035 will total $23.1 trillion, up 6% from its January 2025 projection. The CBO highlighted three significant Trump administration policies affecting the federal budget: the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' adds $4.7 trillion over a decade, immigration enforcement adds $500 billion, but these are partially offset by higher tariffs expected to reduce the deficit by about $3 trillion. The forecast assumes these policies will remain in effect for the entire 10-year period.

                Sometimes the news demands restraint. Van Der Beek's death felt like it needed the space and gravity of a proper obituary—black border, centered text, the kind of treatment newspapers used to give to figures who mattered. The rest of the day's news flows around it like a traditional broadsheet because sometimes classical forms exist for a reason.
