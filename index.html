                        <p>Nationwide protests in Iran have escalated into one of the most significant challenges to the Islamic Republic in its 47-year history. What began as demonstrations over economic conditions has evolved into a broader movement against the government. Iranian authorities have implemented an internet blackout to suppress information flow, while protesters are reportedly using Starlink satellite internet to bypass restrictions.</p>
                        <p>President Trump issued a stark warning to Iranian leaders, stating "You better not start shooting, because we'll start shooting, too." Iran's Prosecutor-General has threatened to charge protesters as "enemies of God," a capital offense under Iranian law. Despite severe threats of punishment, demonstrators continued taking to the streets late Friday across multiple cities.</p>

                        <p>NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman announced Thursday that the four-person Crew-11 mission will return to Earth ahead of schedule after one crew member experienced an undisclosed medical situation on January 7. The affected astronaut is stable but requires evaluation and treatment available only on Earth. This marks the first time in NASA's 65-year history of human spaceflight that a mission has been cut short due to crew illness.</p>
                        <p>The decision leaves only three people aboard the ISS, significantly impacting station operations and science experiments. Crew-11 members—NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov—launched in August 2025 and were scheduled to remain until around May 2026. A planned spacewalk was cancelled, and NASA is evaluating whether to accelerate the launch of Crew-12, currently scheduled for mid-February.</p>

                        <p>After years of positioning artificial general intelligence as the ultimate goal, major AI companies are collectively retreating from the term. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has called AGI "not a super useful term," while Anthropic's leaders say they've "always disliked" it and now call it "outdated." Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff describes AGI as marketing "hypnosis," and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says it won't "be achieved anytime soon."</p>
                        <p>The shift comes as mounting research suggests that large language models—the technology underpinning most major AI systems—fundamentally cannot achieve general intelligence. Studies from Apple and other institutions conclude that current architectures lack the capability for genuine reasoning and that "chain of thought reasoning" in LLMs is "a mirage." Meanwhile, the industry has committed trillions to data centers designed expressly to build AGI systems.</p>

One year after hurricane-force winds spread wildfires through the Los Angeles region, recovery efforts continue in Altadena and Pacific Palisades, where entire neighborhoods were reduced to ash by the Eaton and Palisades fires—the second and third most destructive blazes in California history.</p>

New "Zone Zero" wildfire rules requiring clearing vegetation within five feet of homes are being debated, with research showing this could reduce structure losses by 17%.
