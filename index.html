    DESIGN BRIEF:
    Today brings a collision of state power: judicial pushback, mass enforcement operations,
    foreign uprisings, and constitutional questions. I'm building a stark, authoritative interface—
    heavy black borders like redacted documents, monochrome with alert-red accents for urgent items.
    The layout feels like a classified briefing: dense, bordered, stamped with official weight.

            <p class="summary-text">The nationwide uprising against Iran's government has reached its sixteenth day as of January 12, 2026. The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK) announced that the death toll between December 28, 2025 and January 11, 2026 exceeded 3,000 across Iran. Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz described the Iranian regime's repressive actions as disproportionate and brutal. President Trump threatened strong military action as hundreds of protesters have been killed. Protests have taken place outside the Iranian Embassy in London, and solidarity demonstrations have been held in Berlin, Aarhus, and other cities worldwide.</p>

            <p class="summary-text">More than 2,000 federal immigration agents are currently deployed in Minnesota, with numbers expected to increase further. On January 12, NPR reporters witnessed multiple instances where immigration agents drove around Minneapolis and in parking lots of big box stores, randomly questioning people about their immigration status. The Trump administration announced it will send hundreds of additional federal agents to Minnesota. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and officials from Minneapolis and St. Paul are filing a temporary restraining order to halt the ICE surge in the Twin Cities. The deployment has sparked protests across the country.</p>

          <div class="article-body">
            <p class="summary-text">On January 13, 2026, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases—Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J.—considering the extent to which gender identity and biological assignment at birth can be considered as factors in scholastic sports competitions. Idaho's Fairness in Women's Sports Act bases competition on biological assignment at birth, with the Ninth Circuit ruling the law violated 14th Amendment Equal Protection rights. In West Virginia, the Fourth Circuit overturned a district court ruling in favor of the state on Equal Protection and Title IX grounds. The cases mark the first time the legality of laws restricting participation in women's sports by biological sex makes its way to the high court.</p>

          <div class="article-body">
            <p class="summary-text">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a significant ruling on January 2, 2026, in Baird v. Bonta, reversing in part a district court's summary judgment upholding California's urban open-carry ban. The panel held that California law strictly prohibits the issuance of open-carry permits in areas where 95% of Californians live, affecting 30 counties with populations below 200,000. The court found that the overwhelming historical consensus that open carry was protected at both the Founding (1791) and during Reconstruction (1868) makes bans on open carry unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. The decision explicitly rejected California's argument that concealed carry permits can substitute for open carry rights.</p>

The application is supported by data from phase 3 DUPLEX and phase 2 DUET studies showing significant reduction in proteinuria compared to irbesartan in children and adults with FSGS. If approved, sparsentan would be the first treatment for this rare kidney disease, which is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. The approval would establish proteinuria reduction as a validated regulatory endpoint in FSGS and provide a non-immunosuppressive, oral treatment option.</p>

The study achieved its primary objective of non-inferiority and superiority, with a statistically significant reduction in mean total annualized bleeding rate compared to the pre-infusion period (1.24 vs 4.73; one-sided p-value=0.0040). Following a single dose, the therapy demonstrated superior bleed protection compared with routine Factor VIII replacement prophylaxis treatment. Treatment-related adverse events generally resolved with clinical management. The results demonstrate the transformative potential of this gene therapy candidate to provide superior bleed protection while helping relieve treatment burden.</p>
