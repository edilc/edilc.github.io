    DESIGN BRIEF:
    Stark brutalist typography with a grid system that breaks at strategic points. 
    One mega-story dominates (China's trade surplus—biggest number, biggest implications), 
    then a compressed grid where stories expand on click. Pure hierarchy through scale and spacing.
    The design feels like information architecture made visible—no decoration, just structure and weight.

            <p class="hero-summary">China reported a record trade surplus of almost $1.2 trillion for 2025, according to government data released Wednesday. The surge came as exports to other countries compensated for slowing shipments to the United States under President Donald Trump's higher tariffs. The record surplus reflects China's continued export dominance despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. This development has significant implications for global trade dynamics and U.S.-China economic relations.</p>

                    U.S. Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to meet Denmark's foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart in Washington on Wednesday to discuss Greenland, which has become the center of a geopolitical storm. The meeting comes one day after Greenland's Prime Minister stated that if forced to choose between the United States and Denmark, Greenland would choose Denmark. The Trump administration has expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, creating diplomatic tensions with Denmark and raising questions about Arctic sovereignty.

                    Minnesota federal prosecutors have resigned following Department of Justice pressure to probe the case of Renee Macklin Good's widow. The FBI is solely leading the inquiry into the killing of Renee Macklin Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross without help from Minnesota authorities. Legal experts are calling the move unusual, explaining that joint investigations between federal and state authorities are typically the norm in such cases. The resignations highlight tensions between federal directives and local prosecutorial independence.

                    The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue is seeking protection from creditors after filing for bankruptcy. The venerable retailer's $2.65 billion purchase of Neiman Marcus failed to spark the growth that executives had anticipated. The bankruptcy filing represents a major development in the luxury retail sector and raises questions about the future of both iconic department store brands. The company is now working to restructure its operations and debt obligations.

                    Iran is moving to execute protesters involved in anti-government demonstrations, with some protesters facing execution within days of arrest as Tehran speeds up trials. Sources told CBS News that at least 12,000 people and possibly upwards of 20,000 are now feared dead as anti-government protests continue and the regime threatens to begin executions. President Trump has commented on his potential response if executions by hanging occur, raising the prospect of U.S. intervention or sanctions.

                <div class="article-meta">SCOTUSblog</div>
                <div class="article-summary">
                    The Supreme Court heard arguments on January 12 in a Louisiana environmental case where a state jury ordered Chevron to pay $745 million for wetlands restoration in Plaquemines Parish. At issue is whether oil and gas companies can move lawsuits from state to federal court under a World War II-era statute. The case turns on federal officer removal jurisdiction and could have significant implications for where environmental cases are heard—state courts typically being less favorable to big oil. Chief Justice Roberts and others questioned how far the companies' proposed rule could extend.

                <div class="article-meta">Federal News Network</div>
                <div class="article-summary">
                    The USPTO has published proposed regulations that would create a 'one-and-done' system for inter partes review, where patents that survive any initial validity challenge become virtually immune from subsequent IPR proceedings. The rules would require petitioners to forfeit all anticipation and obviousness defenses in district court if their IPR is instituted—even for defenses not included in the petition. The changes would particularly benefit patent holders by allowing strategic first suits against less sophisticated defendants to immunize patents from stronger challenges later.

                <div class="article-summary">
                    Researchers at the University of Southampton developed engineered antibodies that cluster multiple immune cell receptors at once, dramatically increasing the strength of signals that activate T cells to attack cancer. Published in Nature Communications, the antibodies target CD27, a receptor that needs a ligand cancer cells don't produce. By grabbing and clustering several receptors, the four-pronged antibodies compensate for the missing natural signal. In early studies, they outperformed conventional antibodies at activating cancer-killing immune cells.

                <div class="article-meta">Nature</div>
                <div class="article-summary">
                    Two hundred African biodiversity experts performed a comprehensive survey finding that sub-Saharan Africa has lost an average of 24% of its pre-industrial faunal and floral abundances, published in Nature. Rwanda and Nigeria were least intact at under 55%, while Namibia and Botswana remained around 85% intact. Most remaining organisms are found in unprotected rangelands and natural forests where people co-exist with nature, suggesting that inclusive conservation approaches may be crucial.

                <div class="article-meta">Drugs.com</div>
                <div class="article-summary">
                    The FDA approved Zycubo (copper histidinate) on January 12, 2026, a copper replacement therapy for the treatment of Menkes disease in pediatric patients. Menkes disease is a rare, often fatal genetic disorder affecting copper metabolism. This represents a new treatment option for a devastating pediatric condition that typically results in severe neurological impairment and early death.

                Today's news has this satisfying quality where everything is dense and consequential—$1.2 trillion, $745 million, 20,000 deaths—so I wanted the design to reflect that weight through pure typographic mass. The hero story is sized to dominate because that's genuinely the biggest number and probably the most structurally important story. Then the grid compresses everything else into uniform cells that expand when you want depth. It's basically information density made legible through hierarchy. No color, no ornament—just scale doing all the editorial work.
