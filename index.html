                        Record valuations and major AI investments have fueled concerns about a potential bubble. AI leaders like OpenAI and Nvidia have made staggering deals with cloud infrastructure companies, while hyperscalers including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google continue billions in data center spending. The enormous debt financing these buildouts has sparked worry that the spending spree may prove to be an overreach.

                        Despite Taiwan's per capita GDP forecast to top $40,000 this year amid the AI boom, economists warn of K-shaped industrial growth resulting in wage disparities. While the electronics and semiconductor industries offer high pay, the service sector employing over 7 million people offers relatively low wages. Taiwan's economy is largely driven by AI-related exports with divergent sector performance.
