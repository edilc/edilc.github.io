    "brief": "Today felt like a day for restraint and clarity\u2014pure typographic hierarchy with no decoration. The news is heavy (protests, deaths, constitutional crises) but not apocalyptic, so I wanted a design that feels like a well-edited newspaper: confident scale shifts, generous whitespace, and rhythm built entirely through type weight and spacing. Let the words breathe."

    "brief": "The strangest story today is Trump saying elections should be cancelled. That level of constitutional absurdity deserves a DEFCON aesthetic\u2014the page is a command center terminal tracking democratic threats in real-time. Everything is green-on-black CRT terminal style with red alerts for the most dangerous stories. The design treats the news like a threat monitoring system because, well, it kind of is."

    "brief": "The AI child abuse story is utterly horrifying\u2014a 26,000% increase isn't a statistic, it's a societal emergency. The page becomes a monitoring system tracking crisis levels across today's news. Everything is rendered as data readouts on a surveillance dashboard, with the AI story triggering maximum alert status. Blues and reds, clean monitoring aesthetic, pulsing indicators showing severity. The design itself becomes a warning system."
