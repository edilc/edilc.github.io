    "brief": "Today's news has the texture of a system under stress\u2014storms, crackdowns, data breaches, geopolitical maneuvering. It feels like watching alerts scroll across a command center screen. The page becomes a terminal interface, a DOS-era system struggling to process incoming threats, where each news item is a logged event requiring attention. Green phosphor glow, CRT flicker, the aesthetic of maximum information density meeting technological constraint."

    "brief": "Today's news gets the full 1997 GeoCities treatment: tiled teal background, Comic Sans everywhere, under construction banners, visitor counters, and outset borders. The winter storm becomes the \"featured\" yellow card with star bursts, while serious geopolitical news sits in little hoverable boxes with link buttons. It's a commitment to the aesthetic chaos of early web optimism meeting today's heavy news cycle."

    "brief": "Two-thirds of America buried in snow\u2014this is a system crash waiting to happen. The page becomes Windows 98 struggling under the weight of 200 million error messages, where each news story is a dialog box or window fighting for attention. The featured storm dominates like a frozen blue screen, while smaller windows cascade down with protests, diplomacy, and science updates. Everything feels like it's running on limited resources, just barely holding together."

    "brief": "Two-thirds of America buried under ice and snow\u2014180 million people on alert. Today's design responds with pure typographic scale: the storm story becomes monumentally large (7rem headlines), dominating the page like the weather system itself dominates the continent. Everything else arranges around it in descending hierarchy. No weather graphics, no blue color schemes\u2014just massive type that creates its own gravity, pulling smaller stories into orbit. Let white space and proportion do the atmospheric work."

    "brief": "Pure typographic hierarchy across extreme scale\u2014from 9rem hero headlines to compact 1.25rem treatments. The winter storm dominates like it dominates the continent, with subsequent stories arranged by visual weight rather than chronology. Minimal decoration: just clean sans-serif type, generous whitespace, and large numerals as the only graphic element. Space Grotesk provides geometric precision with warmth."

    "brief": "Today's news has a strong scientific thread\u2014CRISPR breakthroughs, DNA methylation, immune cell mapping. The design responds with a laboratory aesthetic: petri dishes (circular cards), microscope slides (featured stories), and an animated DNA helix in the header. Clean, specimen-like presentation that treats each story as something to examine and analyze. A refreshing shift from recent typographic approaches."

    "brief": "Today's news is dominated by temperature extremes\u2014a massive winter storm paralyzing the Eastern U.S., power outages in freezing conditions in Ukraine, and India celebrating Republic Day in pleasant weather. The design responds with a weather map aesthetic: stories are \"temperature zones\" with cold/warm color gradients, circular temperature badges, and an animated temperature bar across the top. Featured story gets the full forecast treatment. It's a literal interpretation of the atmospheric theme running through multiple articles, turning the news page into a meteorological chart."

    "brief": "Today's news is scattered and chaotic\u2014deaths from winter storms, ICE killings, social media trials, Iran crackdowns, NATO warnings, peace talks, tech outages, gold surging. Nothing connects neatly. The design responds with a deliberately broken grid: articles collide, overlap, and refuse to align. Each story gets its own rotation, its own color-coded border, its own violation of layout rules. The page feels like papers scattered on a desk after an earthquake\u2014nothing in its place, but everything still visible."
