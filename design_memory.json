    "brief": "Two-thirds of America buried under ice and snow\u2014180 million people on alert. Today's design responds with pure typographic scale: the storm story becomes monumentally large (7rem headlines), dominating the page like the weather system itself dominates the continent. Everything else arranges around it in descending hierarchy. No weather graphics, no blue color schemes\u2014just massive type that creates its own gravity, pulling smaller stories into orbit. Let white space and proportion do the atmospheric work."

    "brief": "Pure typographic hierarchy across extreme scale\u2014from 9rem hero headlines to compact 1.25rem treatments. The winter storm dominates like it dominates the continent, with subsequent stories arranged by visual weight rather than chronology. Minimal decoration: just clean sans-serif type, generous whitespace, and large numerals as the only graphic element. Space Grotesk provides geometric precision with warmth."

    "brief": "Today's news has a strong scientific thread\u2014CRISPR breakthroughs, DNA methylation, immune cell mapping. The design responds with a laboratory aesthetic: petri dishes (circular cards), microscope slides (featured stories), and an animated DNA helix in the header. Clean, specimen-like presentation that treats each story as something to examine and analyze. A refreshing shift from recent typographic approaches."

    "brief": "Today's news is dominated by temperature extremes\u2014a massive winter storm paralyzing the Eastern U.S., power outages in freezing conditions in Ukraine, and India celebrating Republic Day in pleasant weather. The design responds with a weather map aesthetic: stories are \"temperature zones\" with cold/warm color gradients, circular temperature badges, and an animated temperature bar across the top. Featured story gets the full forecast treatment. It's a literal interpretation of the atmospheric theme running through multiple articles, turning the news page into a meteorological chart."

    "brief": "Today's news is scattered and chaotic\u2014deaths from winter storms, ICE killings, social media trials, Iran crackdowns, NATO warnings, peace talks, tech outages, gold surging. Nothing connects neatly. The design responds with a deliberately broken grid: articles collide, overlap, and refuse to align. Each story gets its own rotation, its own color-coded border, its own violation of layout rules. The page feels like papers scattered on a desk after an earthquake\u2014nothing in its place, but everything still visible."

    "brief": "Today's most surprising story is barocaloric cooling\u2014using pressure to create cold through phase changes in household chemicals. This immediately suggests a pressure vessel aesthetic: the entire page becomes a system of pressure chambers holding different stories at different intensities. The barocaloric discovery drives everything: gauges, indicators, chamber designs, and a cool blue palette suggesting refrigeration without greenhouse gases."

    "brief": "Today's news has the chaotic energy of mid-90s internet\u2014attacks, crashes, international tensions, corporate earnings, all competing for attention. So I'm going full Geocities: tiled backgrounds, visitor counters, under-construction GIFs, window chrome, Comic Sans headlines, and marquee scrolls. Each story gets its own \"window\" you can maximize/minimize. It's nostalgic, playful, and transforms heavy news into digestible chunks through deliberate retro camp."

    "brief": "Today's stories are about institutional pressure: the Fed resisting Trump, Congress pressuring DHS, the administration pressuring colleges, and Medicare being squeezed. Every story is about systems under strain. So the page becomes a pressure monitoring system\u2014each story sits in its own pressure chamber with visual indicators of intensity. Strict duotone CRT terminal green on black, maximum contrast."

    "brief": "Today's news is a chaotic mix of government dysfunction, legal drama, and institutional pivots\u2014classic January 2026 energy. Following the creative nudge, I'm going full mid-90s Geocities: tiled backgrounds, window chrome, Comic Sans, under-construction GIFs, visitor counters, spinning icons, and click-to-expand articles. Each story is a colorful window-styled card with animated icons, because if you can't have fun with the news, what's the point?"
