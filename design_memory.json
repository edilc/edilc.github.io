Everything else orbits around this crisis\u2014legal rulings, tragedies, policy rebukes, uncertainty at FDA. The page becomes a solar system with the market disruption as its sun, and all other stories as satellites pulled into its field. Click any satellite to expand and read its orbit-specific details."

    "brief": "Today's news felt like standing in a gallery where each piece demands individual attention\u2014no single crisis dominates, but each story is weighty in its own right. The page becomes a curated exhibition with each article as a framed piece. Clean, contemplative, breathing room. After days of tension and data dashboards, today we slow down and observe."

It feels like watching events unfold across different timescales and magnitudes. The page becomes a chronological thread where each story is a node you can expand, with color-coded dots pulsing along a gradient line. Click to dive deeper into the timeline."

    "brief": "Today's news has the texture of a system under stress\u2014storms, crackdowns, data breaches, geopolitical maneuvering. It feels like watching alerts scroll across a command center screen. The page becomes a terminal interface, a DOS-era system struggling to process incoming threats, where each news item is a logged event requiring attention. Green phosphor glow, CRT flicker, the aesthetic of maximum information density meeting technological constraint."

    "brief": "Today's news gets the full 1997 GeoCities treatment: tiled teal background, Comic Sans everywhere, under construction banners, visitor counters, and outset borders. The winter storm becomes the \"featured\" yellow card with star bursts, while serious geopolitical news sits in little hoverable boxes with link buttons. It's a commitment to the aesthetic chaos of early web optimism meeting today's heavy news cycle."

    "brief": "Two-thirds of America buried in snow\u2014this is a system crash waiting to happen. The page becomes Windows 98 struggling under the weight of 200 million error messages, where each news story is a dialog box or window fighting for attention. The featured storm dominates like a frozen blue screen, while smaller windows cascade down with protests, diplomacy, and science updates. Everything feels like it's running on limited resources, just barely holding together."

    "brief": "Two-thirds of America buried under ice and snow\u2014180 million people on alert. Today's design responds with pure typographic scale: the storm story becomes monumentally large (7rem headlines), dominating the page like the weather system itself dominates the continent. Everything else arranges around it in descending hierarchy. No weather graphics, no blue color schemes\u2014just massive type that creates its own gravity, pulling smaller stories into orbit. Let white space and proportion do the atmospheric work."

    "brief": "Pure typographic hierarchy across extreme scale\u2014from 9rem hero headlines to compact 1.25rem treatments. The winter storm dominates like it dominates the continent, with subsequent stories arranged by visual weight rather than chronology. Minimal decoration: just clean sans-serif type, generous whitespace, and large numerals as the only graphic element. Space Grotesk provides geometric precision with warmth."
