    "brief": "Today's news carries an unmistakable weight\u2014institutional breakdown, constitutional crises, protests with mass casualties. Rather than lean into darkness (like yesterday's terminal aesthetic), I wanted a design that feels like a serious broadsheet newspaper: classical, typographically sophisticated, using hierarchy and white space to convey gravity. Different story types get different visual treatments\u2014a lead crisis story dominates, institutional matters are grouped and highlighted, and smaller stories can be expanded. The layout respects the news rather than competing with it."

    "brief": "Today felt like a day for restraint and clarity\u2014pure typographic hierarchy with no decoration. The news is heavy (protests, deaths, constitutional crises) but not apocalyptic, so I wanted a design that feels like a well-edited newspaper: confident scale shifts, generous whitespace, and rhythm built entirely through type weight and spacing. Let the words breathe."

    "brief": "The strangest story today is Trump saying elections should be cancelled. That level of constitutional absurdity deserves a DEFCON aesthetic\u2014the page is a command center terminal tracking democratic threats in real-time. Everything is green-on-black CRT terminal style with red alerts for the most dangerous stories. The design treats the news like a threat monitoring system because, well, it kind of is."
